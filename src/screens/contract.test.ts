/**
 * The inspector reads `DocumentInspection`, which the backend serializes with
 * `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`. A property name that does not match
 * arrives as `undefined`: the overview read a field that does not exist, and
 * `report.pages.length` on a payload with no `pages` array blanked the entire
 * window. The type checker did not catch it, because a duplicate `PageGeometry`
 * interface had been merged into the real one.
 *
 * This test closes that gap from the other side. It reads payloads captured
 * from real documents (regenerate them with
 * `cargo test -p pdfcore --test inspection_contract -- --nocapture`) and checks
 * the inspector screen against them, so a field added on the Rust side cannot
 * then be quietly ignored, and a field the backend never sends cannot be read.
