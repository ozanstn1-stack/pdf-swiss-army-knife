/**
 * A bulk insert once ran the Turkish strings through
 * `value.encode("utf-8").decode("unicode_escape")`, which reads UTF-8 bytes as
 * Latin-1. Every non-ASCII character came out doubled - "ç" became "Ã§" - and
 * the application shipped with mojibake in the entire Turkish interface while
 * both the type checker and every functional test stayed green.
 *
 * The tell is a Latin-1 letter in the range U+00C0-U+00FF immediately followed
 * by a character in U+0080-U+00BF, which is what UTF-8 bytes look like when
 * someone reads them as Latin-1. Real Turkish text has no such sequence.
